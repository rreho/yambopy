# QuREX: Quantum Real-space Exciton Analysis

## Welcome to the QuREX Documentation

QuREX (Quantum Real-space Exciton Analysis) is a comprehensive theoretical and computational framework for understanding excitonic properties in quantum materials. This documentation provides detailed theoretical foundations, practical tutorials, and software implementation guides for researchers working with excitons, electron-phonon coupling, and optical properties of materials.

## What is QuREX?

QuREX combines many-body theory with computational tools to analyze:

- **Excitonic States**: Bound electron-hole pairs and their properties
- **Electron-Phonon Coupling**: Interactions between excitations and lattice vibrations  
- **Optical Properties**: Absorption, emission, and photoluminescence spectra
- **Real-Space Analysis**: Spatial distribution and localization of excitons
- **Symmetry Properties**: Group theory analysis of excitonic states

## Key Features

### Theoretical Framework
- Many-body formalism based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation
