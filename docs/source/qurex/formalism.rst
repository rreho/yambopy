Formalism
=============

The `QuREX` code is an extension of the `yambopy` library. It focusses on computing electronic and optical properties of materials from a localized basis set.
It can model electronic system via tight-binding model Hamiltonian or second-principles wannierized Hamiltonians.

Keep in mind that this code is still in **beta** version.
Any bug reports and feedback are welcome!

The code is hosted in rreho's forked yambopy repository  Github:
