To create `yambopy`'s documentation you might need the `jupyter-book` and `sphinx` library.

Once you have those you can compile the code API-documentation via

`make html`

While for the QuREX book you can go inside the QuREX-book folder and execute the commands

`jupyter-book build`.
`open _build/html/index.html`
